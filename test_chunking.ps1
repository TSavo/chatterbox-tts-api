This is a comprehensive test of the Chatterbox TTS API's new intelligent chunking system.
This extensive piece of text has been specifically designed to exceed the forty-second duration limit.

The purpose of this test is to verify that the system can handle long-form content effectively.
When text exceeds the maximum duration threshold, the API automatically breaks it down into smaller, manageable chunks.
These chunks are created by analyzing the text for natural breaking points.

First, the system looks for paragraph breaks, which are indicated by double line breaks.
If paragraphs are still too long, it then examines single line breaks.

Next, it considers sentence boundaries marked by periods, exclamation points, and question marks.
The system also recognizes clause boundaries: commas, semicolons, and colons all provide opportunities for intelligent splitting.

Each chunk is processed individually by the TTS model, generating separate audio segments.
These segments are then seamlessly concatenated using FFmpeg to create a single, cohesive audio file.
The result should sound natural and continuous, as if it were generated as a single piece.

This chunking strategy solves a critical limitation of many TTS systems.
If you're hearing this complete message as a single audio file, then the chunking system is working perfectly!
